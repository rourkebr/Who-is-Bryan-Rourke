            I am a sports professional with 10+ years in the industry. I grew up in southeast Michigan and lived in the
            state for 26 years before moving to Arizona. As the youngest of three I grew up playing sports year round
            and even building ice rinks in my back yard. At the age of 6 I underwent open-heart surgery. Thought it was
            a challenge, it has made me who I am today. While attending Michigan State University, I was a student
            manager with the women's softball team. This led me to coach collegiate softball for four years at the D1,
            D2, and D3 levels. While coaching at Adrian College, I was fortunate enough to part of a collegiate national
            championship in hockey. My love and passion for sports let me to meeting my now wife. (she played golf in
            college and professionally). We have been married for a year and welcomed our first child, our daughter, Zoe
            in September.
